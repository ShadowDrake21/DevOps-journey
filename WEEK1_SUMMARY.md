# WEEK 1 SUMMARY

## Commands I Mastered
- `ls`, `cd`, `pwd` – navigating directories  
- `mkdir`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `touch` – file and directory management  
- `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail` – viewing file contents  
- `cp`, `mv` – copying and moving files  
- `echo` – printing messages and variables  
- `who`, `ps`, `top`, `htop` – monitoring users and processes  
- `chmod`, `chown` – managing permissions  
- `grep`, `awk`, `sed` – text searching and processing  
- `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git clone` – basic Git workflow  
- `bash script.sh` – executing scripts  
- `>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>&1` – output and error redirection  
- `tar`, `gzip` – archiving and compressing files  

## Bash Constructs I Still Find Tricky
- Array handling and iteration  
- Advanced conditional expressions (`[[ ... ]]`)  
- Functions with return values  
- `set -euo pipefail` nuances  
- Proper error handling in pipelines  
- Combining multiple redirections in one command  

## Short Plan for Week 2 (What to Improve)
1. **Bash Scripting**  
   - Master arrays, functions, and argument parsing  
   - Practice robust error handling (`set -euo pipefail`)  
   - Modularize scripts for reusability  

2. **Linux Processes**  
   - Learn job control (`&`, `fg`, `bg`, `jobs`)  
   - Signals (`kill`, `trap`)  
   - Monitoring CPU and memory usage with scripts  

3. **Automation Basics**  
   - Schedule scripts with `cron`  
   - Logging strategies for automated scripts  
   - Combine Bash with Git for version-controlled automation  

4. **DevOps Mindset**  
   - Idempotent, repeatable scripts  
   - Logging and error reporting as default behavior  
   - Start thinking of scripts as small services for CI/CD pipelines

**Note:** Week 1 was focused on Linux fundamentals, Git basics, and writing simple Bash scripts. Week 2 will build on this with intermediate Bash and process automation, laying the foundation for real DevOps tasks.
