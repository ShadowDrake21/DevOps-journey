1. Defenition of CI/CD: 
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Deployment). Itâ€™s a DevOps practice that automates building, testing, and deploying code changes, enabling faster and more reliable software releases.
2. Key differences between CI and CD:
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are two practices at the core of modern software development. They are interconnected, yet distinct, approaches that aim to streamline and expedite software development and delivery. 

CI and CD are similar in that they both focus on automation, frequent code changes, and a commitment to maintaining a high-quality, releasable codebase. 
CD is different from CI in the sense that CI focuses on preparing code for release (build/test) and CD involves the actual release of code (release/deploy).
3. Example use-case of CI/CD:
A common CI/CD use case is to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a web application. For example, when a developer commits code to a repository, a CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers the following steps: a build job compiles the code, a test job runs automated tests, and if all tests pass, a deployment job pushes the new version to a staging or production environment.
