Phase 1 - Warm-up and Deep dive: Linux process control:
I have read the next article to gain knowledge I needed:
- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nohup-command-in-linux;
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/shell-scripting-disown-command/;
- https://www.suse.com/c/observability-sigkill-vs-sigterm-a-developers-guide-to-process-termination/ (section: SIGTERM vs SIGKILL: An In-depth Comparison).

Then I have done a small task: 
ps aux | head
pstree -p
jobs
kill -l

After that I have practiced with process states and priority manipulation:
1. I have started three background states;
2. I have used ps, top and renice to manipulate priorities;
3. I have written a script process_control.sh to manipulate with processes.
