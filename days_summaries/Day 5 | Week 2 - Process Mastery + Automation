Phase 1 - Warm-up and Deep dive: Linux process control:
I have read the next article to gain knowledge I needed:
- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nohup-command-in-linux;
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/shell-scripting-disown-command/;
- https://www.suse.com/c/observability-sigkill-vs-sigterm-a-developers-guide-to-process-termination/ (section: SIGTERM vs SIGKILL: An In-depth Comparison).

Then I have done a small task: 
ps aux | head
pstree -p
jobs
kill -l

After that I have practiced with process states and priority manipulation:
1. I have started three background states;
2. I have used ps, top and renice to manipulate priorities;
3. I have written a script process_control.sh to manipulate with processes.

Phase 2 and 3 - Task automation with cron + logs and Log cleaner
I have created the script system_report.sh and set it up to be executed in cron every 2 hours.
I have also created the script log_cleaner.sh. It also was set in cron to run every 3 hours.

Practice: 
I have built:
- redirection_test.sh;
- robust_script.sh;
- system_maintenance_suite.sh - for automation of the monitoring, cleanup, reporting of system health;
- cron_scheduler.sh - for setting system_maintenance_suit.sh to the cron.
