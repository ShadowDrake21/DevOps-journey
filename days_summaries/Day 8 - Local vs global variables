I have started from the theory to the first part of the day "Advanced Bash Fundamentals":

- Local vs global variables: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/batch-script-local-vs-global-variables/;
- $?, exit, return, and why every automation script must check exit codes (generated by ChatGPT);
- Debugging with bash -x (generated by ChatGPT);
- How scripts get executed (PATH, shebangs): https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87560/does-the-shebang-determine-the-shell-which-runs-the-script;
- Why idempotence matters in DevOps (script should be repeatable and safe) (generated by ChatGPT).
