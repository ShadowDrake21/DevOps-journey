Part 1 - GitLab Runner Theory + Setup:
First of all, the sources I have read from:
- What is a GitLab Runner and Runner lifecycle - https://www.baeldung.com/ops/gitlab-runner-guide;
- Executor types: shell, docker, virtualbox, kubernetes - https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/;
- The difference between: .gitlab-ci.yml (definition), GitLab Runner (execution) - generated by ChatGPT.

Also I have registered a new runner with description as "local-runner" and executor as "shell". Then I verified it by using gitlab-runner list and gitlab-runner status.
