Part 1 - GitLab Runner Theory + Setup:
First of all, the sources I have read from:
- What is a GitLab Runner and Runner lifecycle - https://www.baeldung.com/ops/gitlab-runner-guide;
- Executor types: shell, docker, virtualbox, kubernetes - https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/;
- The difference between: .gitlab-ci.yml (definition), GitLab Runner (execution) - generated by ChatGPT.

Also I have registered a new runner with description as "local-runner" and executor as "shell". Then I verified it by using gitlab-runner list and gitlab-runner status.

Part 2 - Adding a Deploy Stage:
Here I have extended my pipeline from yesterday by adding a deploy stage that simulates application delivery.
- I added runner tag to this job (local-runner);
- Manually ran the deploy stage;
- Checked if the /tmp/devops_deploy/ folder was created and populated (It really was).

Next I have added another deploy job for "staging", tried when: on_success instead of manual and added a conditional environment variable "production".

Part 3 - Triggers, Dependencies, and Cleanup:
I have begun from theory:
- Job dependencies with needs: - https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/needs/;
- Pipeline triggers: Automatic start from another project or schedule (generated by ChatGPT);
- Retry & Cleanup jobs - https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ (retry and cancel jobs);
- Artifacts:expire_in best practices - https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#allow_failure.

Then to my .gitlab-ci.yml I have added "cleanup" stage.
Next I scheduled it in GitLab, setting cron to @daily and description to Daily cleanup.
