Part 1 - Pipeline Structure Deep Dive:
First of all, I have learnt a lot new information from the next sources:
- stages (build → test → deploy),jobs inside stages,how stages execute in sequence:  https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/ (Types of pipelines, Configure a pipeline, Run a pipeline manually, View manual pipeline variables), https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/pipeline_architectures;
- The .gitlab-ci.yml evaluation logic (Generated by ChatGPT);
- Artifacts (persisting build results): https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/job_artifacts/;
- Variables (in YAML and GitLab UI): https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/ (before Mask a CI/CD variable);
- only: / except: rules for controlling job execution: https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/deprecated_keywords/.

Plus I have made a short note with three questions and answers: short_note.md.

Part 2 - Build a 3-Stage Pipeline:
I have created a real multi-stage pipeline for my system_report.sh with:
- lint - syntax check;
- test - functional tests;
- package - compress and store results.

Then I have also tried and added an intentional error in my Bash script -> saw CI fail -> fixed it -> rerun.
Experimented with when: manual for the package stage and run the pipeline manually via GitLab UI.

Part 3 - Environment Variables + Secrets:
I have worked on these articles:
- https://forum.gitlab.com/t/what-is-the-preferred-way-of-storing-a-variable-in-gitlab-without-any-collaborator-ever-seeing-it/90867/5;
- https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/ (Protect a CI/CD variable; Hide a CI/CD variable; Mask a CI/CD variable);
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78157839/how-to-run-a-bash-script-with-parameters-in-gitlab-ci;
- https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/job_scripts/ (partly).

Also I have added a variable ENV_MODE with value: production with GitLabUI.
I have edited my CI job by using $ENV_MODE in test stage.
Then I have run a pipeline and confirmed that the variable appears in logs.
Next I have created a .env file in my repo and loaded it dynamically in .gitlab-ci.yml.

Part 4 - Pipeline Debuggin + Visualization:
- Understanding .gitlab-ci.yml linter: https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/lint/;
- Debugging failed jobs: logs, exit codes, artifacts (generated by ChatGPT);
- Viewing job duration, queue times, and runner usage (generated by ChatGPT);
- Pipeline graph visualization (generated by ChatGPT).

Then practice:
- I intentionally broke YAML by missing : and used CI Lint to find error;
- Added set -euxo pipefail to my script and reran pipeline;
- Analyzed the pipeline graph;
- Downloaded job artifacts from builds/.
