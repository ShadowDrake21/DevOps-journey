Part 1 - Pipeline Structure Deep Dive:
First of all, I have learnt a lot new information from the next sources:
- stages (build → test → deploy),jobs inside stages,how stages execute in sequence:  https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/ (Types of pipelines, Configure a pipeline, Run a pipeline manually, View manual pipeline variables), https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/pipeline_architectures;
- The .gitlab-ci.yml evaluation logic (Generated by ChatGPT);
- Artifacts (persisting build results): https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/job_artifacts/;
- Variables (in YAML and GitLab UI): https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/ (before Mask a CI/CD variable);
- only: / except: rules for controlling job execution: https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/deprecated_keywords/.

Plus I have made a short note with three questions and answers: short_note.md.

Part 2 - Build a 3-Stage Pipeline:
I have created a real multi-stage pipeline for my system_report.sh with:
- lint - syntax check;
- test - functional tests;
- package - compress and store results.

Then I have also tried and added an intentional error in my Bash script -> saw CI fail -> fixed it -> rerun.
Experimented with when: manual for the package stage and run the pipeline manually via GitLab UI.
