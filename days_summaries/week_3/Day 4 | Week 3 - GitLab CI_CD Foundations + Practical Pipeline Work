Part 1 - Deep dive into GitLab CI/CD core concepts (theory + examples):

First of all, I have been working on the next topics:
- GitLab CI/CD architecture: .gitlab-ci.yml structure, jobs → stages → pipelines, before_script, after_script, artifacts, cache, rules, only/except - https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml;- Runner concepts: shared vs. specific runners, tags, executors (shell, docker), pipeline triggers;
- Pipeline flow: how GitLab links commits → pipelines → runners, YAML parsing order,debugging with CI_DEBUG_TRACE=true - generated by ChatGPT.

Next I have written a short YAML snipper that runs two jobs in sequence (build -> test) and prints simple messages. I have also validated it with GitLab UI validator.

Part 2 - Practice: Create & test a multi-job pipeline:
