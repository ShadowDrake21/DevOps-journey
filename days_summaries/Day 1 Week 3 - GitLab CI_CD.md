Part 1 - Core CI/CD Theory (2.5 hours):
Firstly, I have learnt information from that articles and video materials:
- https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd;
- DevOps CI/CD Explained in 100 Seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scEDHsr3APg;
- CI/CD Explained: The DevOps Skill That Makes You 10x More Valuable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AknbizcLq4w;
- CI/CD Explained | How DevOps Use Pipelines for Automation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4CXOocovZ4;

Also I have read information and practiced the pipelines from that awesome article:
- Comprehensive Guide to GitLab CI/CD: https://medium.com/@yian806884/comprehensive-guide-to-gitlab-ci-cd-081305b06a9a.

Part 2 - GitLab Setup + First Repo:
First of all, I have explored GitLab functionality:
- Settings -> CI/CD -> Runners;
- CI/CD -> Pipelines;
- Settings -> Variables.
Then in order to see the full power of GitLab web UI I have changed README.md (oh my God, that web VS Code is something amazing) and then pulled it localy.

Part 3 - GitLab Runner Deep Dive:
I have read the articles on the next topics:
- https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/;
- shared runners vs specific runners (also generated by ChatGPT): https://forum.gitlab.com/t/difference-between-shared-and-specific-runenrs/54581;
- Runner lifecycle and permissions (generated by ChatGPT).

I have installed GitLab Runner and Docker on my Linux Ubuntu system.

Part 4 - First .gitlab-ci.yml Pipeline:
I have learnt neccessary information from the sources:
- https://spacelift.io/blog/gitlab-ci-yml (part: .gitlab-ci.yml file keywords);
- https://forum.gitlab.com/t/how-to-change-ci-cd-diagram-look-functionality/46089.

I have also created a simple practical .gitlab-ci.yml named .gitlab-ci-practice.yml.
