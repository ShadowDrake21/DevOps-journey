I have started from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-F3YLd6oMw.
I have read and written every example from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/bash-scripting-tutorial-linux-shell-script-and-command-line-for-beginners/.
Next I have had time for a practice:
- I implemented several simple Bash scripts;
- Also I created a small project script ("System Info").
