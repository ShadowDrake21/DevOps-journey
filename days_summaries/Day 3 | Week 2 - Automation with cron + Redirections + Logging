Phase 1 - Mastering Redirections:
First of all, I have read these articles to understand the topic better:
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/input-output-redirection-in-linux/;
- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/linux-shell-redirection-pipelining.
Then I have practiced:
1) ls /etc > files.log
ls /not_real_dir 2> errors.log
cat files.log errors.log;
2) ping -c 3 google.com > ping.log 2>&1;
3) Created the script redirection_test.sh.

Phase 2 - Cron and Scheduling:
Next I have learned the concepts from these articles and videos:
- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/linux-cron-command;
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v952m13p-b4;
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cbP7fzn0D8;
- https://eitca.org/cybersecurity/eitc-is-lsa-linux-system-administration/advancing-in-linux-sysadmin-tasks/scheduling-tasks-with-cron/examination-review-scheduling-tasks-with-cron/where-are-user-crontabs-and-system-wide-crontabs-stored;
- How cron runs in non-interactive shells (PATH issues!) (generated by ChatGPT);
- https://www.networkworld.com/article/965762/using-logger-on-linux.html.

I have also created a script auto_backup.sh that added to crontab and then validated cron logs.

Phase 3 - Automation Project: Silent DevOps Logger:
I have created a script "system_audit.sh" that combines everything: redirections, signals, cron, sending emails to the mail.
The only problem I had had there was seding emails to the my email address, because of setting up the credentials, but everything went successfully eventually.
