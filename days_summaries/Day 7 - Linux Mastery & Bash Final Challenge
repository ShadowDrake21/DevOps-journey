First of all, I have had a quick system refresh and environment prep: update packages and clean cache, check disk and memory usage, exploration of shell environment.

Next I have done practical tasks:
1) Permissions and ownership:
- created users devops 1, devops2;
- created shared directory /srv/devops_data and gave read/write permissions to both users gvia group permissions;
- set permissions correctly;
- made sure new files in the folder inherit group (sudo chmod g+s /srv/devops_data).
For that I read additional sourses:
- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/linux-groups;
- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/linux-access-control-lists.

2) System monitoring:
- created some command aliases;
- made a Bash script monitor.sh that:
-- shows top 5 CPU and memory processes;
-- displays current load average and uptime;
-- saves output to a log file;
-- uses date in logs to timestamp.
