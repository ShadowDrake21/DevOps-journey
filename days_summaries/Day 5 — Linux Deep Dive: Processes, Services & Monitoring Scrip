I have begun from watching video materials:
- KILL Linux processes!! (also manage them) // Linux for Hackers // EP 7 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfC6pv8VISk);
- How Does Linux Boot Process Work? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpFsMB6FoOs);
- Linux processes, init, fork/exec, ps, kill, fg, bg, jobs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJzltwv7jJs);
- start, stop, restart Linux services (daemon HUNTING!!) // Linux for Hackers // EP 6 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWhfNB_r-0&t=109s).

The next I have had time for practice:
- commands for practice (htop, ps, kill etc);
- resource analysis (free -h   vmstat 1 5);
- bash project: System Monitoring Script;
- cron job and systemd service for the created script.
