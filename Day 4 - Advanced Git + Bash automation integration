I've started from watching Git for Professionals Tutorial - Tools & Concepts for Mastering Version Control with Git
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uszj_k0DGsg).
Next I've worked on:
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches;
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout.
Next I have created a dummy branch "feature/auto-backup".
The i created two small Bash scripts: 
- auto_commit.sh - automates git pushes
- daily_backup_git.sh â€“ performs daily backup + git push;
Next I've done Real-world simulation (using git commands and CI/CD things).
Next I've created Git pre-commit hook.
