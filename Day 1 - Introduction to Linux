I have begun my Linux journey from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag.
Next:
- https://linuxjourney.com/ - interactive exercises on shell;
- https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/ - Bandit Levels 0–3.
I have read:
- https://blog.kubesimplify.com/linux-system-directories-explained - about Linux folder structure;
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/absolute-relative-pathnames-unix/ - about absolute and relative paths in Linux
I have done these practical tasks:
-Create a file named notes.txt and edit it using nano or vim.
Write down the 5 commands you learned today.
- Create a mini-project: “System Explorer”
Create a folder called devops_day1.
Create a file called report.txt and enter:
-- system info (uname -a)
-- list of files in /home (ls -lah /home)
-- current user (whoami)
-- uptime (uptime)
-- amount of free space (df -h)
-- amount of RAM (free -h).
Save the result in the GitHub repository
